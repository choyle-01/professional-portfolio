                <p>
                    My name is Michael Hoyle and I am a student in the UNCC web development bootcamp. I am learning to
                    be a full stack web developer.
                    I have begun learning HTML and CSS and started a few web page projects and applications. I am 20
                    years old and live in North Carolina.
                    I have 2 dogs that I love very much and enjoy spending time with. In my free time I enjoy gaming,
                    playing guitar, and prop building.
                    <br>
                    As a web developer my goal is to be able to design web pages and applications that work efficently
                    and effectively and to continuously develop my own skills and abilities.
                    The goal of this webpage is to give a look into a few of those projects that I have worked on and to
                    showcase my developing skill as a fullstack web developer.
                    In addition it will also give several ways to get in touch with me in case of questions or
                    inquiries.
